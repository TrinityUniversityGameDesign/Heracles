In order to use moving and one-way platforms you must first add the 3rd party packages
 to your unity project.

First, navigate to the folder that has your unity project, and open the projects' asset folder
	(just in the file browser, not within unity)

Next, drag and drop all three items in the required assets folder into your 
	projects' own assets folder

If you have unity open during this it should pop up a dialogue and automatically 
	load them when you click back over to it. 

Done, should be able to use the prefabs.
